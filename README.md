# Youtube Wrapped
Spotify Wrapped but for youtube. (Because Rewind sucked).

# How to use
1. Request your data from Google using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sank6/Youtube-Wrapped/releases).
3. From your takeout, go to `YouTube and YouTube Music/history` and paste the `watch-history.json` file in the same folder as the executable.
4. Run the executable. (You'll need a [Google API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)).
